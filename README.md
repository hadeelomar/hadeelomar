### Hi there, My Name is Hadeel 👋

## 💻 About Me

My name is Hadeel and I am a Computer Systems Engineering student at Queen Mary, University of London :)

```swift
class Hadeel {
    let age = 22
    let hobbies = ["Coding", "Gaming", "Reading", "Music"]
    let school = "Queen Mary University of London"
    let degree = "Computer Systems Engineering"
    let location = "London, UK"
    
    init() {
        print("Hello, I'm Hadeel! 👋")
    }
}
```

💻 Entering my final year of my studies, my passion lies in back-end development and distributed systems. I'm fascinated by the architecture that powers modern applications - from designing efficient APIs and optimising database queries to building scalable server-side solutions that handle real-world traffic. I'm also seeking graduate roles where I can contribute to building robust, high-performance systems whilst learning from experienced engineers.
