## 💻 About Me

My name is Hadeel and I am a Computer Systems Engineering student at Queen Mary, University of London :)

```java
public class Hadeel {
    private int age = 22;
    private String[] hobbies = {"Coding", "Gaming", "Reading", "Music"};
    private String school = "Queen Mary University of London";
    private String degree = "Computer Systems Engineering";
    private String location = "London, UK";
    
    public Hadeel() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I'm Hadeel! 👋");
    }
    
    public void introduce() {
        System.out.println("Passionate about back-end development & distributed systems");
    }
}
```

💻 In my final year of my studies, my passion lies in back-end development and distributed systems. I'm fascinated by the architecture that powers modern applications - from designing efficient APIs and optimising database queries to building scalable server-side solutions that handle real-world traffic. I'm also seeking graduate roles where I can contribute to building robust, high-performance systems whilst learning from experienced engineers.

## 📍 What Am I Doing?
