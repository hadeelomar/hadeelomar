## Hi there, My Name is Hadeel 👋

## 💻 About Me

My name is Hadeel and I am a Computer Engineering student at Queen Mary, University of London :)

```java
public class Hadeel {
    private int age = 22;
    private String[] hobbies = {"Coding", "Gaming", "Reading", "Music"};
    private String school = "Queen Mary University of London";
    private String degree = "Computer Systems Engineering";
    private String location = "London, UK";
    
    public Hadeel() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I'm Hadeel! 👋");
    }
    
    public void introduce() {
        System.out.println("Final year student developer");
    }
}
```

I'm in my final year of my studies, and my main interest is in back-end development and distributed systems. There's something really cool about building the infrastructure that keeps apps running smoothly - designing APIs that make sense, optimising databases and making systems that can handle thousands of requests without breaking a sweat. With my background in engineering, understanding how software talks to hardware, how signals get processed and how physical systems integrate with code? I believe that's where the real magic happens.

## 📍 What Am I Doing?

- 🎓 Studying: Computer Systems Engineering @ Queen Mary University of London
- 📱 Developing: full-stack development skills, building on my iOS Engineering internship experience at Warner Bros. Discovery (HBO Max)
- 🚀 Learning: architectural patterns, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure and embedded systems development
- 💡 Final year project: developing SpatialSocket - a WebSocket-based API in Flask for real-time server-side spatial audio processing and binaural rendering (think VR experiences or immersive gaming, but with the heavy audio processing happening on the server instead of straining the user's devices)
